<p>Define a deployment table for all many-to-many relations</p>
<p>If a many-to-many relation does not define a deployment table, its data will be stored in the links table along with the data from all the other many-to-many relations that do not define a deployment table. This can cause that table to have a very large number of rows, large indexes and encounter able locks during inserts or updates or deletes. This can have a serious impact on performance.</p>
