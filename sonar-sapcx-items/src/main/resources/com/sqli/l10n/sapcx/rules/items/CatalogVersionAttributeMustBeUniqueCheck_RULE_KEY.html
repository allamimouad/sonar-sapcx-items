<p>Mark CatalogVersion attributes as unique for Catalog aware types.</p>
<p>
    The CatalogVersion attribute forms part of the unique key for Catalog Synchronization.
    To ensure that the same uniqueness rules are applied for other processes (for example, ImpEx),
    you need to set the CatalogVersion attribute to unique="true".
