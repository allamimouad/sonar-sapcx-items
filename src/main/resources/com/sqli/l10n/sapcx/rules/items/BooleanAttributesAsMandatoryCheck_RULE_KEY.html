<p>Define Boolean attributes as mandatory.</p>
<p>
    It is possible to store 3 values for a Boolean attribute (true, false, or null).
    Storing a null is almost always not the desired outcome and it will usually be mapped to a true or false value.
    It's possible that the mapping is not always in place so there is potential for logic errors or
    NullPointerExceptions.
