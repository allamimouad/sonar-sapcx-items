<p>Do not use unoptimized attributes.</p>
<p>Using dontOptimize="true" stores the data for this type in a secondary table defined by the "propertytable" attribute
    of the deployment or the props table if no propertytable is defined.
    Generally, it is not recommended to store attribute values in this way because it is more expensive to store and
    retrieve the values because joins are required. </p>
