<p>Use collectiontype='set' on any side of a relation that has cardinality='many' where items must not appear in that
    relation multiple times.</p>
<p>The set guarantees that every relation is persisted only once. For example, if a Product is related to a Category, it
    is usually desirable to store this relation as one row only in the database. </p>
